## This is the page where I make stuff
###### (against better judgement and common sense)

### A bullet-pointed list of things about me:
 - [Indie YouTube person since 2022](https://youtube.com/@ThatOneSeong)
 - Linux Person since 2021-ish, and [only semi-sane person documenting Linux Arcade Gaming since 2023](https://gist.github.com/SeongGino/92c5222d0baaf235332e09d2522e76db)
 - Obsessed with Lightguns, which has brought to becoming lead maintainer and primary dev of the [OpenFIRE](https://github.com/TeamOpenFIRE) system since late-2023
 - (Somewhat/somehow) experienced with C++ mostly from embedded projects, primarily for/centered around RP2040
 - Has a mild case of the 'Tisms since 1998
   - ###### Aspie, to be specific
 - Combined 500+ hours (and counting) of Tales of-series ~~brainrot~~ experience
 - Blames everything on Time Crisis 3 (ily <3)

#### If all of that sounds impressive to you:
 1. ### ***Why?***
 2. Check out whatever it is I've pinned down below - they're at least marginally less shitty than the rest of the stuff here.

I'll eventually make videos about some of this stuff...
